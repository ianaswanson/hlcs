# Compass - Knowledge Layer v1

**HLCS Tier 2: Knowledge Layer - Ontological, Evaluative, Procedural**

This document teaches how to work with the Compass artifact - the strategic foundation that answers "Where are we going and why?" for a product or business.

**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025

---

## Ontological Layer: WHAT is a Compass?

### Definition

The **Compass** is the strategic foundation artifact that establishes true north for all downstream product decisions. It answers fundamental questions about viability, direction, and positioning before committing resources to building.

Unlike tactical artifacts (story maps, architecture docs), the Compass operates at the "should we build this?" level, not the "how do we build it?" level.

### Core Purpose

The Compass forces intellectual honesty about:
- Who exactly are we serving?
- Is the problem big enough to build a business around?
- Why would they choose us over alternatives?
- Why is NOW the right time?
- How do we make money?
- What must be true for this to work?

### Relationship to Other Artifacts

```
COMPASS (Strategic)     → "Should we build this? Why?"
    ↓
TELESCOPE (Discovery)   → "What opportunities exist? What problems are worth solving?"
    ↓
MAP (Story Map)         → "What exactly are we building? In what order?"
    ↓
BLUEPRINT (Architecture) → "How do we build it technically?"
```

The Compass constrains and informs all downstream work. A feature that contradicts the Compass should either not be built or should trigger a Compass revision.

### Overview

| Section | Core Question | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Vision** | Why do we come to work? | Inspirational prose (created last, shown first) |
| **Pitch** | What's the elevator pitch? | Moore template - clinical positioning statement |
| **Customer** | Who exactly? | The human "who" - buyer/user/champion |
| **Problem** | What hurts? Is it big enough? | Pain + evidence of willingness to pay |
| **Solution** | How do we solve it? | Our approach and what we build |
| **Unique Value** | Why us? Hard to copy? | Differentiation and moat |
| **Timing** | Why now? | What changed that enables/demands this |
| **Market** | Where are we playing? | Landscape, alternatives, beachhead, size |
| **Revenue** | How do we make money? | Pricing model and economics |
| **Truths & Bets** | What's real vs assumed? | Intellectual honesty layer |

### Section Details

#### Vision (The Inspiration)

**Source:** Jeff Patton (product vision framing)

The Vision is a prose statement about why you come to work - the inspirational future you're trying to create. It's the poetry that motivates the team.

**Key Principle:** Created LAST (after working through all canvas elements), but shown FIRST (it's the hook when presenting to others).

**Quality Criteria:**
- **Audacious enough** to focus on what should be possible, not what current constraints allow
- **Inspirational enough** to energize people beyond current frustrations
- **Human enough** to connect with real community impact and lived experience
- **Valuable enough** to maintain focus through changing priorities and leadership
- **Specific enough** to guide strategic decisions without prescribing solutions

**Test:** Does it describe human transformation, not technological capability?

**Example (good):**
> Work should be visible. When you can see everything laid out in front of you - what's done, what's happening, what's next - collaboration stops feeling like coordination overhead and starts feeling like flow. We believe the simple act of moving a card from 'Doing' to 'Done' should feel satisfying, that teams deserve tools that fade into the background and let the work shine through. We're building the whiteboard that travels with you, the sticky note that never falls off, the shared brain for any team doing anything.

**Example (bad):**
> We envision a future where technology helps people do things better and more efficiently.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Technology-focused instead of human-focused
- Abstract jargon without specific scenarios
- Features/capabilities instead of transformation
- "Vision" that could describe any product in your category

---

#### Pitch (The Positioning Statement)

**Source:** Geoffrey Moore's elevator pitch template from *Crossing the Chasm*

The Pitch is a clinical positioning statement that synthesizes all other Compass elements into a communicable pitch. It follows Moore's template:

```
FOR [target customer]
WHO [statement of need or opportunity]
THE [product name] IS A [product category]
THAT [key benefit, compelling reason to buy]
UNLIKE [primary competitive alternative]
OUR PRODUCT [statement of primary differentiation]
```

**Vision vs Pitch:** Vision is the poetry (inspirational), Pitch is the positioning (clinical). Both are created last, both shown first, but serve different audiences and purposes.

**Quality Criteria:**
- Each blank filled with something specific and concrete
- Can be delivered in 30 seconds (elevator pitch test)
- Non-weaselly - forces commitment to specific claims
- Synthesizes insights from other sections

**Anti-patterns:**
- Vague generalities ("helps people do things better")
- Missing sections (unfilled blanks)
- Incompatible with other Compass sections (pitch says one thing, Problem says another)

---

#### Customer (The Human "Who")

**Purpose:** Define exactly who we're serving, recognizing that B2B has multiple stakeholder types.

**Structure:**
- **Buyer**: Who writes the check / makes purchasing decision
- **User**: Who uses the product daily
- **Champion**: Who advocates for the product internally
- **Characteristics**: Defining traits that identify this customer

**Key Insight:** In B2B, buyer ≠ user ≠ champion. Understanding all three is essential for product design (serves user), marketing (reaches buyer), and sales (enables champion).

**Quality Criteria:**
- Specific enough to recognize in the wild
- All three roles identified (or explicitly noted as same person)
- Characteristics are observable/verifiable

**Anti-patterns:**
- Generic ("businesses", "government agencies")
- Conflating buyer/user/champion without acknowledgment
- Characteristics that describe everyone

---

#### Problem (What Hurts)

**Purpose:** Define the pain we're solving AND establish evidence it's worth paying for.

**Structure:**
- **Description**: The pain in plain language
- **Current Alternatives**: How they solve it today (never "nothing")
- **Why Alternatives Fail**: Why current state is insufficient
- **Big Enough**: Evidence this is worth paying for

**Key Insight:** Problems must clear the "big enough" bar across four dimensions:
1. **Real** - they actually feel this pain
2. **Painful** - it hurts enough to want a solution
3. **Urgent** - needs solving now, not someday
4. **Valuable** - worth paying money to fix

Most product failures happen at #3 (not urgent) or #4 (not valuable enough).

**Current Alternatives:** People always have alternatives. Options include:
- Manual workarounds
- Spreadsheets / email
- Ignoring the problem
- Hiring people
- Competitor products
- Building it themselves

Understanding alternatives informs positioning and willingness to pay.

**Quality Criteria:**
- Problem is specific, not abstract
- Alternatives are realistic (what they actually do today)
- "Big enough" has evidence, not just assertion
- Clear articulation of why alternatives fail

**Anti-patterns:**
- Abstract problem ("inefficiency in workflows")
- Alternatives listed as "nothing" or only direct competitors
- "Big enough" asserted without evidence
- Problem that's real but not urgent or valuable

---

#### Solution (How We Solve It)

**Purpose:** Define our approach and what we're building.

**Structure:**
- **Approach**: Our method/insight (the "how")
- **What We Build**: The product/service (the "what")
- **Key Capabilities**: Core features/functions (the specifics)

**Quality Criteria:**
- Approach is clearly linked to the Problem
- What we build is concrete, not abstract
- Capabilities map to customer needs

**Anti-patterns:**
- Solution looking for a problem
- Technology-first thinking ("we'll use AI to...")
- Capabilities not connected to stated problem

---

#### Unique Value (Why Us)

**Purpose:** Articulate what makes us different and defensible.

**Structure:**
- **Differentiation**: What makes us different from alternatives
- **Hard to Copy**: The moat / unfair advantage

**Differentiation** answers: "Why would they choose us over alternatives?"

**Hard to Copy** (the moat) answers: "What prevents competitors from replicating us?"

Common moat categories:
- Network effects (value increases with users)
- Proprietary data (unique dataset)
- Switching costs (expensive to leave)
- Brand (trust, reputation)
- Regulatory (licenses, certifications)
- Technology (patents, hard-to-replicate tech)
- Distribution (unique channel access)
- Cost advantages (economies of scale)

**Quality Criteria:**
- Differentiation is meaningful to customer (not just different)
- Moat is honest (many startups don't have one yet)
- Connected to Problem and Customer sections

**Anti-patterns:**
- Differentiation that customers don't care about
- Fake moats ("first mover advantage" is rarely a moat)
- Claiming moats that don't exist yet

---

#### Timing (Why Now)

**Source:** Sequoia Capital pitch deck framework; Bill Gross research on startup success factors

**Purpose:** Articulate why this opportunity exists NOW rather than 5 years ago or 5 years from now.

**Structure:**
- **Thesis**: What changed that enables or demands this
- **Factors**: Specific shifts (technology, regulatory, behavioral, cost, market)
- **Window**: How long is this window open (optional)

**Key Insight:** Timing is the #1 predictor of startup success according to Bill Gross's analysis of 200+ startups - more important than team, idea, business model, or funding.

**Common Timing Categories:**
| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Technology shift | "LLMs can now analyze documents at $0.10/doc vs $50/hour for humans" |
| Regulatory change | "New transparency law requires agencies to respond to all public testimony" |
| Behavioral shift | "COVID normalized remote work, changing software buying patterns" |
| Cost curve | "Cloud + AI costs dropped enough to make per-document pricing viable" |
| Market maturity | "GovTech is now a recognized category with proven procurement paths" |
| Competitive gap | "Incumbents are 15-year-old on-prem systems that can't adapt" |
| Convergence | Multiple factors aligning simultaneously (often the strongest) |

**Quality Criteria:**
- Timing thesis is specific and verifiable
- Factors are real changes, not wishful thinking
- Explains why this wasn't possible/viable before
- Explains why waiting would be a mistake

**Anti-patterns:**
- No timing thesis (assuming "now" without articulation)
- Timing thesis that was also true 5 years ago
- Wishful timing ("the market is ready")

---

#### Market (Where We're Playing)

**Purpose:** Define the competitive landscape and our entry strategy.

**Structure:**
- **Landscape**: Key players, alternatives, market context
- **Beachhead**: Initial segment we focus on dominating first
- **Size**: TAM/SAM/SOM or qualitative sizing

**Market vs Customer:** Market is the "mechanics" (size, segments, competition). Customer is the "human" (who they are, what they need). Related but distinct.

**Beachhead** (Geoffrey Moore): The initial market segment you focus on dominating before expanding. The "land" in "land and expand."

**Quality Criteria:**
- Landscape is honest about competition and alternatives
- Beachhead is specific and achievable
- Size is realistic (not inflated TAM)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Claiming no competition
- Beachhead too broad ("all government agencies")
- TAM that's meaningless ("$50B market")

---

#### Revenue (How We Make Money)

**Purpose:** Define the business model and economics.

**Structure:**
- **Pricing Model**: How we charge (subscription, usage, license, etc.)
- **Price Point**: What we charge
- **Cost Drivers**: Major costs
- **Unit Economics**: CAC, LTV, margins (when known)

**Quality Criteria:**
- Pricing model matches customer expectations and problem urgency
- Price point is evidence-based (not arbitrary)
- Cost drivers are realistic
- Unit economics are honest (include unknowns)

**Anti-patterns:**
- "We'll figure out pricing later"
- Price point with no rationale
- Ignoring major cost drivers
- Fake unit economics

---

#### Truths & Bets (Intellectual Honesty Layer)

**Purpose:** Maintain intellectual honesty by separating what we know from what we're betting on.

**Structure:**
- **Truths**: Facts that are just true and matter
- **Bets**: Assumptions we must be right about

**Truths** are constraints, context, non-negotiables. They can't be wished away.

Examples:
- "Government procurement cycles are 6-18 months"
- "Oregon legislative session runs Jan-June in odd years"
- "Our target buyer has $50K discretionary budget"
- "We have 4 months of runway"

**Bets** are hypotheses. If they're wrong, the whole thing falls apart.

Examples:
- "Legislative affairs professionals will pay for AI-powered testimony analysis"
- "Our cost per analysis will be under $0.50"
- "Word-of-mouth will be our primary acquisition channel"
- "The market is big enough to support a venture-scale business"

**Quality Criteria:**
- Truths are actually true (verifiable)
- Bets are actually bets (unproven assumptions)
- Nothing important is hidden in neither category
- Both categories are populated (empty = red flag)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Empty Truths (everything looks like it's in our control)
- Empty Bets (everything looks certain)
- Bets disguised as Truths
- Important constraints missing

---

## Evaluative Layer: WHAT Makes a Good Compass?

### Overall Quality Criteria

A good Compass is:

1. **Specific**: Each field contains concrete content, not vague generalities
2. **Honest**: Truths & Bets don't hide uncomfortable realities
3. **Coherent**: Sections support each other (Vision synthesizes, Problem connects to Solution, etc.)
4. **Evidence-backed**: Claims have rationale, not just assertion
5. **Compressible**: Vision statement works as 30-second pitch
6. **Actionable**: Downstream work can reference it for decisions

### Section-by-Section Checklist

| Section | ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Vision | Human transformation, audacious, specific | Technology-focused, abstract jargon |
| Pitch | All blanks filled specifically | Vague, unfilled blanks |
| Customer | Buyer/user/champion identified | Generic "customers" |
| Problem | Evidence of WTP, real alternatives | Asserted without evidence |
| Solution | Connected to problem | Technology-first |
| Unique Value | Meaningful to customer, honest moat | Fake differentiation |
| Timing | Specific thesis with factors | "Now is the time" with no substance |
| Market | Honest landscape, specific beachhead | No competition, vague beachhead |
| Revenue | Evidence-based pricing | "Figure it out later" |
| Truths & Bets | Both populated, nothing hidden | Empty categories |

### Anti-Pattern Summary

**The Vague Compass:**
- Generic customer segments
- Abstract problems
- "We'll figure out pricing"
- Missing timing thesis

**The Dishonest Compass:**
- No competition claimed
- Empty Truths & Bets
- Fake moats
- Inflated TAM

**The Incoherent Compass:**
- Vision doesn't match Problem
- Solution doesn't address stated pain
- Beachhead doesn't match Customer
- Sections contradict each other

**The Incomplete Compass:**
- Missing sections entirely
- Key blanks unfilled
- "TBD" placeholders

## Procedural Layer: HOW to Create a Compass

### Creation Order vs Display Order

**Creation Order** (how you build it):
1. Work through canvas elements (Customer, Problem, Solution, etc.)
2. Each element informs the others (iterate as understanding deepens)
3. Truths & Bets crystallize through the process
4. Vision and Pitch created LAST as compression of everything above

**Display Order** (how you present it):
1. Vision and Pitch FIRST (the hooks - Vision for inspiration, Pitch for positioning)
2. Supporting elements provide evidence and depth
3. Truths & Bets as grounding/honesty check

### Expected Workflow (Human + AI Collaboration)

**Phase 1: Discovery** (AI asks questions)
- "What is the product goal?"
- "Who are the primary users vs buyers?"
- "What problems do they face?"
- "What are you betting will be true?"
- "Why is now the right time?"

**Phase 2: Generation** (AI creates initial compass)
- Apply methodology from this document
- Fill all sections with best understanding
- Flag areas of uncertainty
- Provide rationale for choices

**Phase 3: Review** (Human examines output)
- Check against quality criteria
- Identify missing elements
- Note vague or generic content
- Provide corrections and additions

**Phase 4: Refinement** (AI updates based on feedback)
- Make requested changes
- Explain modifications
- Re-check quality criteria
- Flag remaining gaps

**Phase 5: Approval** (Human confirms)
- Compass is complete enough to use
- Ready as input for downstream work

### Iteration Expectations

The Compass is not static. Expect to revisit when:
- A major Bet is validated or invalidated
- Market conditions shift significantly
- Pivot or significant scope change occurs
- New Truth emerges from customer contact
- Downstream work reveals Compass gaps

---

## AI-Native Considerations

### Claude Code Consumption

The Compass artifact feeds downstream AI processes. When Claude Code runs `/new-feature` or starts discovery, it needs to reference Compass to understand:
- Who are we building for? (Customer)
- What problem are we solving? (Problem)
- What's our moat? (Unique Value)
- What are the constraints? (Truths)
- What assumptions are we making? (Bets)

### Machine Readability

The YAML structure enables queries like:
- "What's the primary customer segment?"
- "What assumptions haven't been validated yet?"
- "What's our pricing model?"
- "What constraints apply to this decision?"

### Stateless Session Support

Each Claude Code session starts fresh. The Compass provides:
- Context without re-explanation
- Constraints without re-discovery
- Strategic grounding for tactical decisions
- Intellectual honesty framework (Truths & Bets)

### Decision Support

When making trade-offs, Claude Code can reference:
- Does this serve our Customer (buyer/user/champion)?
- Does this address our Problem?
- Does this align with our Timing thesis?
- Does this violate any Truths?
- Does this depend on untested Bets?
