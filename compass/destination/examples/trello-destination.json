  "vision": "Work should be visible. When you can see everything laid out in front of you - what's done, what's happening, what's next - collaboration stops feeling like coordination overhead and starts feeling like flow. We believe the simple act of moving a card from 'Doing' to 'Done' should feel satisfying, that teams deserve tools that fade into the background and let the work shine through. We're building the whiteboard that travels with you, the sticky note that never falls off, the shared brain for any team doing anything.",

  "problem": {
    "description": "Teams can't see their work. Project status lives in people's heads, buried in spreadsheets, scattered across email threads, or stuck on whiteboards that don't travel. This invisibility creates constant 'what's the status?' interruptions, duplicated effort, dropped balls, and a persistent low-grade anxiety about whether things are actually getting done.",
    "current_alternatives": [
      "Spreadsheets - flexible but not visual, hard to collaborate, get stale",
      "Physical whiteboards and sticky notes - visual but don't travel, can't share remotely",
      "Basecamp - comprehensive but heavyweight, learning curve, opinionated workflow",
      "Email threads - ubiquitous but chaotic, no status visibility, things get lost",
      "Nothing - keep it all in your head, ask people constantly"
    ],
    "why_alternatives_fail": "Existing tools force a choice: either powerful-but-complex (Basecamp, MS Project) or simple-but-limited (spreadsheets, sticky notes). The powerful tools require commitment - training, setup, workflow decisions - that small teams won't make for 'just tracking some tasks.' The simple tools lack collaboration and real-time visibility. Nothing sits in the sweet spot of 'powerful enough AND instantly usable.'",
    "big_enough": "Basecamp has paying customers proving teams will pay for collaboration tools. Project management software is a validated category. But adoption is limited by complexity - most teams try these tools and abandon them. The gap between 'people who need to track work' and 'people using work-tracking tools' is massive. We're not competing for Basecamp's customers; we're expanding the market to everyone who gave up on project management software."

    "differentiation": "Instantly usable. No training required. No setup wizard. No workflow configuration. You see a board, you understand it. You can teach someone Trello in 30 seconds by showing them your screen. This isn't a feature - it's the entire product philosophy. Every feature request gets evaluated against 'does this make Trello harder to understand in the first 30 seconds?'",
    "hard_to_copy": "Simplicity is the hardest thing to copy. Every competitor will be tempted to add features. Product managers justify their existence by shipping features. Sales teams want checkboxes for RFP comparisons. Our moat is the discipline to say no - to keep Trello simple while others make their products complex. This is a cultural moat, not a technical one."

  "timing": {
    "thesis": "The browser just became powerful enough. HTML5, WebSockets, and modern JavaScript frameworks make it possible to build rich, real-time applications that feel native. Two years ago, the drag-and-drop experience we need wasn't possible in a browser. Two years from now, everyone will be building this. Right now, we can be first.",
    "factors": [
      "Technology: Browser capabilities (drag-and-drop, real-time sync via WebSockets) just matured",
      "Behavioral: Startup boom creating thousands of small teams needing lightweight tools",

    "landscape": [
      "Basecamp - established, respected, but heavyweight and opinionated",

      "Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel) - ubiquitous but not purpose-built",

    "beachhead": "Small tech teams and startups. They're comfortable with new web tools, frustrated with existing options, have urgency to move fast, and will spread the word to other teams. Not enterprise (too slow to adopt), not individuals only (need collaboration to prove value).",
    "size": "TAM is 'everyone who manages work' - effectively unlimited but meaningless. Beachhead is ~500K small tech teams globally. If 10% adopt and 5% of those convert to paid, that's 2,500 paying teams. At $100/mo average, that's $3M ARR from beachhead alone before expansion."

  "revenue": {
    "pricing_model": "Freemium. Core product free forever - unlimited boards, lists, cards, and collaborators.
