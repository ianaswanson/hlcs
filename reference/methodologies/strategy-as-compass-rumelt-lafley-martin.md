# Strategy as Compass Framework

**Sources:**
- "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt
- "Playing to Win" by A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin
- Distilled by Ian Swanson with Claude (Jackson-60 conversation, ~June 2025)

**Context:** This framework synthesizes Rumelt's diagnosis/guiding policy/coherent action model with Lafley/Martin's "where to play/how to win" choices framework, adapted for product strategy and government digital services.

## Core Definition

**Strategy is your explicit theory about how you'll create more value than the status quo.** It's not vision (the destination) or tactics (the specific actions), but the **coherent logic** connecting current reality to desired outcomes.

### Strategy Must Answer Three Questions

1. **What's wrong with how we currently serve people?** (The diagnosis)
2. **What approach will create better outcomes?** (The guiding policy)
3. **How will these specific actions work together?** (Coherent action)

This is straight from Rumelt's Good Strategy/Bad Strategy framework: **diagnosis, guiding policy, coherent action**.

## The Scale Problem

Roadmaps often fail because they confuse **strategic direction** with **tactical initiatives**. Teams end up managing task lists instead of steering toward meaningful value. The same work can be a user story, epic, or initiative depending on your vantage point.

**Solution:** Strategy should serve as a **decision-making compass** for the 2-5 year journey toward vision. It guides choices about which initiatives to pursue, adapt, or abandon as you learn - not prescribe specific solutions.

## Framework: Strategy as Compass

### Problem Diagnosis
**What's systematically broken about how we currently serve people?**

Focus on patterns and root causes, not specific pain points:
- Where does our current approach consistently fail users?
- What assumptions drive current service design that don't match user reality?
- Which constraints are artificial (process-based) vs. real (legal/resource)?
- What creates the fundamental gap between user expectations and current delivery?

**Example:** "Our current approach assumes people interact with government during business hours with desktop computers and full attention spans, but users actually need services while mobile, stressed, and managing multiple life demands."

### Guiding Principles
**How we'll make decisions on the journey to vision**

Decision-making criteria that will hold up for 2-5 years:
- When choosing between competing initiatives, we'll prioritize...
- We'll know we're heading in the right direction when...
- Our approach to balancing [compliance/equity/efficiency/user experience] will be...

**Example:** "When choosing between options, we'll prioritize solutions that eliminate steps existing for government convenience rather than user needs, even when those steps feel safer for staff."

### Focus Areas
**Where we'll look for opportunities**

Broad domains where initiatives will emerge:
- Which user journeys or service areas will receive concentrated attention
- What types of problems we'll actively investigate
- Where we'll concentrate discovery and solution efforts

**Note:** These are areas of investigation, not specific solutions.

**Example:** "We'll concentrate efforts on services where people currently must visit offices in person, looking for digital-first alternatives that maintain service quality."

### Trade-offs
**What we won't chase to maintain strategic focus**

Explicit choices about what we'll defer or ignore:
- Which problems we won't solve in this strategic period
- What user groups or use cases we'll address later
- Which internal efficiency improvements we'll defer for public value focus

**Example:** "To focus resources on end-user experience improvements, we'll defer internal workflow optimization projects unless they directly impact public service delivery."

## The Compass Test

Strategy content should pass these tests:

- **Will this guide decisions even when technology changes?** ✓
- **Will this help us choose between competing initiatives?** ✓
- **Does this explain WHY we're heading this direction, not WHAT we'll build?** ✓
- **Could this framework still apply in 3 years with different initiatives?** ✓

## Language Guidelines

### Compass-Level Language (Use This)
- "Eliminate steps that exist for government convenience rather than user needs"
- "Treat user identity as a service asset, not a barrier"
- "Design for how people actually access services (mobile, stressed, multitasking)"
- "Prioritize solutions that reduce cognitive load for users in crisis situations"

### Initiative-Level Language (Avoid in Strategy Section)
- "Redesign the permit application process"
- "Implement single sign-on across all services"
- "Create a mobile-first website"
- "Build a customer portal"

---

## Roadmap Hierarchy

This creates clear scale separation:

- **Vision** = The destination (5+ years, science fiction future)
- **Strategy** = The compass (2-5 year decision framework)
- **Goals** = Navigation checkpoints (1-2 year behavioral outcomes)
- **Initiatives** = Current path segments (quarterly discovery experiments)
- **Solutions** = Tactical moves (what we're building now)

The strategy compass stays stable while everything below it adapts based on learning and changing context.

## Common Failure Modes

### Strategy Becomes Initiative List
**Problem:** Strategy section lists big important projects instead of decision-making principles
**Fix:** Ask "Will this guide my choices about future initiatives I haven't thought of yet?"

### Too Concrete for Strategic Level
**Problem:** Strategy includes specific systems, features, or processes
**Fix:** Move concrete items down to initiative level, keep strategic principles

### Missing Trade-offs
**Problem:** Strategy tries to do everything, provides no guidance for choices
**Fix:** Explicitly state what you won't do to maintain focus

### Internal Process Focus
**Problem:** Strategy optimizes for government convenience over public value
**Fix:** Ensure all strategic principles connect to improved citizen outcomes

## Integration with Framework

This strategy compass approach integrates with the broader product framework:

- **Diagnosis** connects to user research and discovery work
- **Guiding Principles** inform initiative prioritization and solution design
- **Focus Areas** guide where to invest discovery and research capacity
- **Trade-offs** prevent scope creep and maintain outcome focus

The strategy compass ensures that tactical work (initiatives, solutions, user stories) serves the strategic direction while allowing for adaptive learning and course corrections.

## Template Structure

**Problem Diagnosis**
What's systematically broken about how we currently serve people? Focus on patterns and root causes, not specific pain points. What assumptions drive current service design that don't match user reality? Which constraints are artificial (process-based) vs. real (legal/resource)?

**Guiding Principles**
How will you make decisions on the journey to your vision? These should be decision-making criteria that will hold up for 2-5 years:
- When choosing between competing initiatives, we'll prioritize...
- We'll know we're heading in the right direction when...
- Our approach to balancing [compliance/equity/efficiency/user experience] will be...

**Focus Areas**
Where will you look for opportunities? Broad domains where initiatives will emerge, not specific solutions:
- Which user journeys or service areas will receive concentrated attention
- What types of problems you'll actively investigate
- Where you'll concentrate discovery and solution efforts

**Trade-offs**
What will you choose NOT to do to maintain strategic focus? Explicit choices about what you'll defer or ignore to concentrate resources on maximum value impact.
