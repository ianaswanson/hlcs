# Now/Next/Later Roadmap Framework

**Source:** Jenna Bastok (ProdPad founder)
**Ian's Rigor:** Language progression + clear artifact type differentiation
**Context:** Distilled in Jackson-60 conversation (~June 2025)

## Core Concept (Jenna Bastok)

Jenna Bastok's original framework uses **time horizons instead of dates**:
- Don't commit to specific dates on roadmaps
- Use relative horizons: Now, Next, Later
- Flexibility to adapt as you learn
- Focus on direction, not timeline commitments

**Problem:** Original framework is fairly loose - doesn't specify what types of items belong in each horizon or how to describe them.

---

## Ian's Added Rigor

### 1. Language Progression

Items should be described differently based on their horizon:

| Horizon | Language Type | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **NOW** | Concrete delivery | Things ready for user hands |
| **NEXT** | User value being created | Solutions being designed |
| **LATER** | Problems to explore | Investigation spaces |

The language shifts from **concrete → value-focused → exploratory** as you move from Now to Later.

### 2. Clear Artifact Type Definitions

Each horizon contains a **different type of work** that requires different management:

#### NOW = Deliverables
**Things being released to users this quarter**
- Written as concrete outputs ready for user hands
- "Planned for Release"
- Focus: Output (because validation work is already done)
- Management: Project tracking, shipping criteria
- Example: "Launch permit renewal self-service portal"

#### NEXT = Solutions
**User value being created through solutioning work**
- Clear problems being solved with defined approaches
- "Solutioning"
- Focus: User value creation
- Management: Design validation, user testing
- Example: "Enable small business owners to renew licenses without office visits"

#### LATER = Investigations
**Problem spaces being explored**
- Areas where we haven't done enough investigation to know if we'll act
- "Problems to Explore"
- Focus: Discovery
- Management: Research planning, learning goals
- Example: "Understand pain points in multi-agency service journeys"

---

## Why This Rigor Matters

**Without clear types:**
- Teams put the same item in multiple columns with different phrasing
- No clarity on what management approach to use
- Roadmap becomes vague promises instead of clear commitments

**With clear types:**
- Different management approaches for each horizon
- Language signals maturity level automatically
- No more "initiative" refuge words
- Clear accountability for what's being committed to

---

## Integration with Strategy Framework

Now/Next/Later sits **below** Vision/Strategy/Goals in the roadmap hierarchy:

```
VISION (5+ years) = What should be possible
  ↓
STRATEGY (2-5 years) = Decision-making compass
  ↓
GOALS (1-2 years) = User behavior change evidence
  ↓
NOW/NEXT/LATER (Quarterly) = Execution plan
  ├── NOW: Deliverables (concrete, shipping this quarter)
  ├── NEXT: Solutions (solutioning, next quarter)
  └── LATER: Investigations (exploring, future quarters)
```

The Now/Next/Later grid shows **how you're executing** toward your goals and strategy.

## Template Language

From Ian's roadmap template:

**NOW Column Header:**
"Now (Planned for Release)"

**NEXT Column Header:**
"Next (Solutioning)"

**LATER Column Header:**
"Later (Problems to Explore)"

**Language Progression Note:**
- Now: Concrete delivery
- Next: User value being created
- Later: Problems to explore

---

## Common Failure Modes

### Treating All Horizons the Same
**Problem:** Same language/detail level across all three columns
**Fix:** Shift language type based on horizon - concrete → value-focused → exploratory

### Putting Same Item in Multiple Columns
**Problem:** "Phase 1 permit portal" (Now) + "Phase 2 permit portal" (Next) + "Phase 3 permit portal" (Later)
**Fix:** Use different artifact types - Deliverable (Now) vs. Solution (Next) vs. Investigation (Later)

### No Management Differentiation
**Problem:** Treating investigations like deliverables (asking for shipping dates)
**Fix:** Match management approach to artifact type

---

## Force Specificity Principle

**Ian's additional constraint:** If you can't name something specifically, you don't understand it well enough to put it on a roadmap.

This forces teams to:
- Think clearly before committing resources
- Avoid vague "strategic initiative" language
- Do real discovery before claiming something is "Next"

**Example of vague (bad):**
- Later: "Improve customer experience"

**Example of specific (good):**
- Later: "Investigate why 40% of permit applicants call for help instead of completing online applications"

---

## Relationship to Jenna Bastok's Original

**What Ian kept:**
- Time horizons (Now/Next/Later) instead of dates
- Flexibility to adapt as you learn
- Focus on direction over timeline commitments

**What Ian added:**
- Specific language progression (concrete → value → exploratory)
- Clear artifact type definitions (Deliverables → Solutions → Investigations)
- Different management approaches per horizon
- Force specificity principle
- Integration with Vision/Strategy/Goals hierarchy

**Why the rigor matters:** Jenna's framework gives you the structure (horizons), but Ian's additions give you the **discipline** to use it consistently and meaningfully.

## Quick Reference

| Horizon | Artifact Type | Language | Timeframe | Management |
|---------|--------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| NOW | Deliverables | Concrete outputs | This quarter | Project tracking |
| NEXT | Solutions | User value | Next quarter | Design validation |
| LATER | Investigations | Problem spaces | Future quarters | Research planning |
