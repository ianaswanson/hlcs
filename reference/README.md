# HLCS Reference Library

Curated source materials that inform the HLCS navigation instruments. This folder is building a knowledge base that will eventually become RAG material for the HLCS product.

## Purpose

This reference library:
1. **Documents sources** - What methodologies inform each instrument
2. **Provides provenance** - Why we made specific design choices
3. **Enables synthesis** - Raw material for creating knowledge layers
4. **Builds RAG corpus** - Future knowledge base for HLCS product

## Contributing

When adding reference materials:
- Use descriptive filenames: `author-name-topic.md`
- Include source attribution and key concepts
- Extract relevant insights, don't just copy-paste books
- Link from instrument knowledge layers to show connections
