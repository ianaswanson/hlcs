# Blueprint - Architecture Instrument

**Status:** Concept Defined
**Schema:** Not Yet Defined

---

## What is Blueprint?

The **Blueprint** is the architecture instrument. It answers "How do we build it?" by defining the technical design, system architecture, and implementation approach.

---

## Core Questions

- What is the system architecture?
- What are the major components and their relationships?
- What technology choices do we make?
- What is the data model?
- How do the pieces fit together?

---

## Source Methodologies (Preliminary)

- **Architecture patterns** - Modular design, separation of concerns
- **System design** - Component diagrams, data flow
- **Technical documentation** - C4 model, architecture decision records
- **Database design** - Entity-relationship modeling, schema design

See `reference/frameworks/` for detailed source materials.

## Relationship to Other Instruments

```
COMPASS → TELESCOPE → MAP → BLUEPRINT
```

The Blueprint:
- **Receives from Map:** Scoped features, user stories, release plan
- **Feeds to Ship:** Technical specifications, implementation guidance
