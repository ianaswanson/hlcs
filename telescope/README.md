# Telescope - Discovery Instrument

**Status:** Foundation Phase
**Schema:** Not Yet Defined

---

## What is Telescope?

The **Telescope** is the discovery instrument. It answers "What's out there? What opportunities exist?" by exploring the problem space before committing to solutions.

---

## Core Questions

- What problems do users actually face?
- Which problems are most valuable to solve?
- What opportunities exist in the problem space?
- What have we learned from user research?
- Which opportunities align with our Compass direction?

---

## Source Methodologies (Preliminary)

- **Teresa Torres** - Opportunity Solution Trees, continuous discovery
- **Jobs to Be Done** - User motivations and context
- **User research methods** - Interviews, observation, synthesis
- **Discovery frameworks** - Problem space exploration before solution space

See `reference/methodologies/` for detailed source materials.

## Relationship to Other Instruments

```
COMPASS → TELESCOPE → MAP → BLUEPRINT
```

The Telescope:
- **Receives from Compass:** Strategic direction, customer definition, problem hypotheses
- **Feeds to Map:** Validated opportunities, prioritized problem areas, user insights
